      PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND SCREENSHOTS
 the code implements a simple calculator using swing for the GUI and basic arithmetic operations

imports necessary packages
   =javax.swing for GUI components
   =java.awt for layout and event handling
   =java.awt.event for action listeners

Define the CALCULATOR APP class with two instance variables
   =frame (jframe)
   =display (jtextfield)

the CREATE GUI mehod sets up the GUI
   =creates a jframe with a title and default close operation
   =creates a jtextfield for displaying calculations and sets it to non-editable
   =creates a jpanel with a grid layout for the buttons
   =adds buttons with labels from the button array and attaches an action listener to each
   =adds the display field to the north and button panel to the centre of the frame
   =makes the frame visible

the buttonlistener class implements the action listener interface
   =handles the button clicks
     ;if the "=" button is clicked, evaluates the expression in the display field and shows the result.
     otherwise appends the button label to the display field

the evaluate method evaluates a mathematical expression
   =it uses a private inner class with methods to parse the expression, handling addition,subtraction,
   multiplication,division,unary plus and minus,parentheses,numbers and functions

the main method creates an instance of calculator app using swingutilities.invokelater to ensure thread safety
